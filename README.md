# Model-Quality-Project
Will be using multiple models to improve quality

Overview

This project focuses on building and optimizing a Random Forest model to predict customer churn. The dataset includes customer attributes such as credit score, geography, gender, account balance, and activity levels to determine whether a customer is likely to leave. The goal is to maximize the model's ability to identify churners while maintaining high accuracy.

Techniques Used

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique): Balances the dataset by generating synthetic churner cases.

Class Weighting: Adjusts the model to give more importance to churn cases.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model parameters using RandomizedSearchCV to improve performance.

Feature Scaling: Standardizes numerical features to improve model stability.

Final Model Performance

Accuracy: 79.55%

Precision for Churners: 49.82%

Recall for Churners: 68.06%

F1-Score for Churners: 57.5%
